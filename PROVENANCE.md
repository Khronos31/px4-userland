# Source provenance and rights record

`px4-userland` was developed as a standalone product and is intended to become a standalone repository, but it
currently remains in the GitHub fork network and contains derivative portions. This document preserves the
engineering provenance that was previously visible partly through the GitHub fork relationship. It is not a
legal opinion and does not replace the notices in individual source files or the terms in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

## Repository lineage

- Direct source: [`tsukumijima/px4_drv`](https://github.com/tsukumijima/px4_drv), snapshot commit
  `9eedea8c502875a788697984b93b50032339b9aa`.
- Original upstream: [`nns779/px4_drv`](https://github.com/nns779/px4_drv).
- Current product: `Khronos31/px4-userland`, intended standalone Linux/Android/macOS userland product for PLEX PX-Q3U4.
- License for this project and its derivative portions: [`GPL-2.0-only`](LICENSE).

Git author names and commit history are evidence about repository activity; they are not, by themselves, a list of
copyright holders. In particular, a contributor, git author, maintainer, project name, or implementation agent is
not added as a copyright holder here without a separate rights basis. The retained `Copyright (c) 2018-2021 nns779`
line appears only where the audited origin file explicitly contained that notice and the audit found its substantive
expression retained. The tsukumijima-derived portions without a file-local copyright notice are described with a
source-snapshot maintenance fact without guessing a copyright holder. For the smart-card-derived `card.h`,
`card.cpp`, and `card_tests.cpp`, the audit records that the relevant WinUSB source files were committed/maintained
in the direct-parent history by tsukumijima; that is a commit-author and maintenance fact, not a copyright-holder
claim.

## Date and audit scope

The audit covered all 84 files under `userland/`: 17 adapted, 11 mixed, one uncertain, and 55 original under the
audit's engineering classification. The 28 adapted/mixed files below received a prominent file-local notice. Each
date is an estimated port/change date derived from that file's pre-edit mtime calendar date, cross-checked
against the project memory's Increment 3A–4B work recorded on 2026-09-02 and 2026-09-03. These dates are not the
edit date of this provenance pass and are not claims about the exact historical authorship, creation date, or
copyright date of the source. The unavailability of a
complete creation history for the pre-commit userland files is an explicit ambiguity.

## Complete adapted/mixed mapping

The following table has exactly one row for each of the 28 files classified as adapted or mixed by the audit. The
paths in the Origin path(s) column are paths in the direct parent snapshot above.

## Firmware

The firmware binary is not included in the source tree, source archive, or release artifact. It is not a third-party
library. Runtime firmware preparation and licensing are separate from this source provenance record, and the project
does not download, extract, or transform vendor firmware.

`userland/src/firmware.cpp` was classified as `uncertain` at audit time. The post-audit conclusion recorded here and
in the file itself is that it is a project-original Increment 3A implementation: the available source history shows
no evidence that its SHA-256 representation was transcribed from the legacy `driver/` or `winusb/` trees. The
technical claim is limited to the standard FIPS SHA-256 constants and processing.

## Fork-network separation

Removing the GitHub fork relationship does not change copyright, license, derivative-work, or corresponding-source
obligations. The fork badge is provenance metadata, not a substitute for file notices, this mapping, `LICENSE`, or
third-party release materials. Any later standalone import, squash, tag, or binary release must preserve these records
and must not reintroduce historical firmware or Windows signing artifacts into the current product.
